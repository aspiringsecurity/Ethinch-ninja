# Medical Incident Reporting on Stellar & ETH using 1inch Fusion+ SDK

This project enables decentralized reporting of medical incidents and processing of insurance payments across both **Stellar/Soroban** and **EVM-compatible blockchains** using the **1inch Fusion SDK+**.

We leverage:

* **Soroban smart contracts** on the Stellar blockchain for secure, immutable medical incident logs.
* **1inch Fusion+** for routing payments and cross-chain insurance claims via decentralized settlement protocols.

---

## ðŸš‘ Use Case

**For Hospitals, Insurers & Aid Organizations**

* **Report** medical incidents on-chain (Soroban)
* **Verify** and timestamp reports immutably
* **Trigger** insurance claim fulfillment using EVM-compatible smart contracts
* **Execute** cross-chain payments with Fusion+ (e.g., from Stellar to Ethereum or Polygon)

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

This repository follows the recommended structure for Soroban contracts:

```text
.
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ incident_report
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs         # Soroban smart contract for incident logging
â”‚Â Â      â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ test.rs        # Unit tests for the Soroban contract
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ Cargo.toml         # Local dependencies for the contract
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ fusion_swap.ts         # Cross-chain payment script using 1inch Fusion SDK+
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ...                    # Optional web interface for hospitals/NGOs
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml                 # Workspace file for dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## ðŸ§ª Components

### `incident_report` (Soroban Contract)

* Logs medical events immutably
* Supports structured metadata (e.g., patient ID hash, event type, timestamp)
* Emits events for integration with oracles or EVM listeners

### `fusion_swap.ts` (1inch Fusion+ Script)

* Facilitates settlement of insurance claims across chains
* Uses hashlock/timelock logic for conditional transfers
* Integrates EVM smart contract with Soroban triggers


## ðŸ“¡ Fusion+ Integration

Ensure you have:

* Access to 1inch Fusion SDK+
* Private key and relayer rights (if using resolvers)
* EVM-compatible wallet with testnet funds

```ts
// Example: Cross-chain swap from Stellar to Polygon
await executeCrossChainSwap({
  fromChain: 'stellar',
  toChain: 'polygon',
  amount: '1000',
  takerAddress: '<insured_party>',
  secretHash: '<hashlock>'
});
```
